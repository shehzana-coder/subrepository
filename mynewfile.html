    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk,
        lying between the copies of <i>Nature,<br>New Scientist</i>, and all the other
        scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>
        On The<br>Road</i>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and 
        the longer she spent in these four walls the more she<br>felt she needed to 
        be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under the poster with 
        an Oscar wilde quote proclaming that<br>"Work is the refuge of people who 
        have nothing better to do". Although many considered her pioneering work,
        <br>unraveling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyrebonucleic Acid">
        DNA</abbr> to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had 
        something<br>better to do.</p>
